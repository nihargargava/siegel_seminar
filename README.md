These slides were used for an expository seminar at IIT Bombay on 09-11-2020. You can find the video of the seminar [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-f92gzMgZOnJVyr4wykPN9WXezeOgmDF/view?usp=sharing).

[reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) was used to make these slides. The visualizations were made using [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) and were integrated inside using the plugin [reveald3](https://github.com/gcalmettes/reveal.js-d3). See `index.html` for the code of the slides and the folder `LatticeAnimation/` for the `d3.js` scripts of all the visualizations. 


 You can can run these slides from the link below. The final result contains lots of visualizations and a live numerical simulation to explain the Siegel mean value theorem!
